# Codevember 2019 - Day 07: Shape

## About Codevember
[Codevember](http://codevember.xyz) is a challenge for developers to sharpen their creativity and improve their skills. The goal is to build a creative piece of code every day of November. We give you daily hints to inspire you but you can do unrelated sketches.

Let's have fun while coding! I love art and how we can recreate it by coding. In this app, we can see some famous art pieces recreated with circles. The app runs the pixel matrices from the images and create circles with their colors, different radius and alpha values. Swipe left and right to see other pieces.

_This is an iOS app, made in Swift, on XCode and it is a free visual experiment._
